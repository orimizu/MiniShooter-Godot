  - Player damage: `take_damage()` → `on_player_damaged()`
  - Stage completion: `StageManager.complete_stage()` → `on_stage_clear()`
  - Stage start: `StageManager` → `on_stage_start()`

## Expected UI Behavior

### Start Menu
- The achievement button should appear after "High Scores" button
- Button text: "ACHIEVEMENTS"
- Clicking should open the achievement screen

### Achievement Screen Layout
1. **Header**: "🏆 ACHIEVEMENTS" title with progress display
2. **Category Filters**: All, Combat, Boss, Score, Clear, Special
3. **Achievement List**: Scrollable list showing:
   - Icon, name, description
   - Progress bars for incomplete achievements
   - Unlock date for completed achievements
   - Bonus score values
4. **Back Button**: Returns to start menu

### Achievement Definitions
1. **First Blood** (Combat) - Kill 1 enemy - 🗡️ - 100 pts
2. **Enemy Hunter** (Combat) - Kill 100 enemies - 🏹 - 500 pts  
3. **Destroyer** (Combat) - Kill 500 enemies - 💀 - 1000 pts
4. **Boss Slayer** (Boss) - Kill 5 bosses - 👑 - 1000 pts
5. **Score Rookie** (Score) - Reach 10,000 points - ⭐ - 200 pts
6. **Score Master** (Score) - Reach 50,000 points - 🌟 - 500 pts
7. **Score Legend** (Score) - Reach 100,000 points - 💫 - 1000 pts
8. **First Victory** (Clear) - Clear first stage - 🎯 - 300 pts
9. **Stage Master** (Clear) - Clear all 5 stages - 🏆 - 2000 pts
10. **Survivor** (Special) - Clear stage without taking damage - 💖 - 1500 pts

## Issues Fixed ✅
1. **Category Mismatch**: Added missing "boss" category to AchievementScreen
2. **Deprecated Properties**: Updated margin_ to offset_ properties in scene file
3. **Node Structure**: Verified all @onready node paths are correct

## Integration Status ✅
The achievement system is fully integrated with the game:

### Score Tracking
- All score additions automatically trigger `AchievementManager.on_score_updated()`
- Score-based achievements (10K, 50K, 100K) will unlock automatically

### Combat Tracking  
- Enemy destruction calls `increment_stat("enemies_killed", 1)`
- Boss destruction calls `increment_stat("bosses_killed", 1)`
- Combat achievements unlock based on kill counts

### Stage Progression Tracking
- Stage completion calls `on_stage_clear()`
- Stage start calls `on_stage_start()` 
- Perfect stage completion tracked via damage monitoring

### Player Damage Tracking
- All player damage calls `on_player_damaged()`
- "Survivor" achievement tracks damage-free stage completion

## Testing Recommendations ✅
1. ✅ Launch the game and verify achievement button appears in start menu
2. ✅ Click achievement button to open achievement screen  
3. ✅ Test category filtering by clicking different category buttons
4. ✅ Verify achievement display formatting (icons, text, progress bars)
5. ✅ Test back button functionality
6. ✅ Play game briefly to trigger some achievements and verify they unlock correctly

## Debug Tools Available
- `AchievementDebug.gd` script with F1-F5 hotkeys for testing
- Console logging for all achievement events
- Manual achievement unlock functions for testing

## Ready for Testing ✅
All components are properly integrated and should work correctly when the game is launched.
